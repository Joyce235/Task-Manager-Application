# Task Manager Application
The Task Manager Application is a web-based platform designed to help users organize and manage their tasks and to-do lists efficiently. It provides features for creating, updating, prioritizing, categorizing, and tracking tasks, as well as setting deadlines and receiving notifications.

Features
User Authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and log out to access their personalized task management dashboard. Authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure access to user-specific features and data.

Task Management: The application allows users to create tasks with details such as title, description, due date, priority level, and category. Users can update task details, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks when no longer needed.

Task Organization: Tasks are organized and displayed in a user-friendly interface, allowing users to view their tasks at a glance and organize them based on priority, due date, or category. Users can filter tasks by status (e.g., completed, pending) and search for specific tasks using keywords.

Notifications: Users receive notifications for upcoming task deadlines and overdue tasks to help them stay on track and prioritize their workload effectively. Notifications can be delivered via email, SMS, or in-app alerts, depending on user preferences.

Collaboration: Users can collaborate with team members or share tasks with others by assigning tasks, adding comments, and sharing task lists. Collaboration features include real-time updates and notifications for changes made by other users.

Technologies Used
Frontend: The frontend of the application is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Additional libraries and frameworks include React Router for client-side routing, Redux for state management, and Material-UI for styling components.

Backend: The backend of the application is built using Node.js, a server-side JavaScript runtime, and Express.js, a web application framework for Node.js. Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database using Sequelize, an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for Node.js.

Authentication: User authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and bcrypt for secure password hashing. Sessions are managed using HTTP cookies for persistent login sessions.

Notifications: Task notifications are implemented using a combination of cron jobs and email/SMS services such as SendGrid or Twilio. Scheduled tasks periodically check for upcoming deadlines and send notifications to users as needed.
